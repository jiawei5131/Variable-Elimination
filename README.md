# Variable-Elimination

This is a project from CSC384 Artificial Intellegence course.
I modified the partial code of VariableElimination.py and DecisionSupport.py.
The code written in the other .py files are all credited to the staff (TAs and professor Sheila McIlraith and professor Sonya Allin) of the course CSC384H1 2016Spring
