# Variable-Elimination

This is a project from CSC384 Artificial Intellegence course.

I modified the partial code of VariableElimination.py and DecisionSupport.py.
The code written in the other .py files are all credited to the staff (TAs and professor Sheila McIlraith and professor Sonya Allin) of the course CSC384H1 2016Spring

Instructions:

  * This project serves for Variable Elimination of Bayesian Network.
  * VariableElimination.py is the basic VE algorithm for probabilities such P(A|B=b, C=c, ...)
  * DecisionSupport.py is a simple application of VE algorithm for a medical Bayesian Network structure.
  * student_test_a3_q1.py, student_test_a3_q2.py are simple the pre-written tests for correctness.
